How to set up Project. 

As the project goes on, we will install more frameworks/dependices. This read me file should be up to date with all of them! 

Make sure to have node installed in order to run these commands 

Frontend: 

  npm i --save-dev dotenv (this is for the env file) 

Backend: 

  npm i cors express nodemon
