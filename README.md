To download this using git, create a folder where you want to store this repository. Then run

```bash
git clone <link to this repositiory>
```

To run this open two terminals.
On first the terminal run these commands


```bash
cd CEN3031-2024/CenProject/backend
npm i
npm start
```

On the second terminal

```bash
cd CEN3031-2024/CenProject/frontend
npm i
npm start
```

Then the website will host on localhost.
Note if not working initially then on second terminal after opening backend run instead

```bash
node server.js
```
